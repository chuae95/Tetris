Tetris Code
Logic: Create a grid of "0"s and use "1"s to indicate if a space is already filled.
1.Create the grid with a 10 * 20 layout and fill it with 0s by using a nested array
2.Create a single piece and begin by including functionalities such as moving the piece and dropping the piece per second
3.Create the boundaries for the bottom and sides
4.Create the logic to update the values of the 10x20 grid of "0"s using the x, y position and the piece configuration.
5.The grid should only be updated when the fix is deemed to be at the bottom or has labnded on a separate piece. This is when a second piece should be generated
6 In addition, if the user performs a dropMax() action, the page will automatically treat it as the end and a new piece will be autogenerated.
7.If the values cannot be updated, then it means that either it has reached the end or there is already another piece in the grid array.
8.An extra array "spare" has been created to hold the storage piece that can be swapped.
9.Various event listeners have been added to trigger transitions and audio clips.
